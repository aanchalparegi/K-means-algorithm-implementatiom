**K-Means Clustering Implementation**

This repository contains Python code implementing the K-Means clustering algorithm and its application in image compression. The code is organized into sections, each addressing a specific aspect of the algorithm and its application.

**Sections:**

1. **Implementing K-means:**
    - `find_closest_centroids`: Finds the closest centroids for each example.
    - `compute_centroids`: Computes the centroid means based on assigned examples.

2. **K-means on a sample dataset:**
    - Demonstrates K-means clustering on a toy dataset to understand its behavior.

3. **Random initialization:**
    - Explains the strategy for random initialization of centroids in K-means.

4. **Image compression with K-means:**
    - Loads and processes image data.
    - Runs K-means algorithm on image pixels to select representative colors.
    - Compresses the image using the selected centroids.

**Files:**

- **utils.py:** Contains helper functions for loading data and visualizing results.
- **README.md:** Overview of the repository and instructions for running the code.

**Instructions for Use:**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries (NumPy, Matplotlib).
3. Run the code sections sequentially in a Python environment such as Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE.

**Note:** This code is intended for educational purposes and experimentation with K-means clustering and image compression. Feel free to modify and extend it for your own projects or learning purposes.
